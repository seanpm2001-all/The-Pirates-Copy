# DLC

## Usage of DLC

This game contains ethical DLC (DownLoadable Content) which is completely free (both in price and freedom) which is included separately due to storage reasons. It contains absolutely no DRM, absolutely no price tag, and is absolutely redistributable. It is basically an expansion to the game.

I hope that I can slowly make progress into making DLC an innocent term again.

## List of DLC

This game currently has 3 planned DLC pieces, they include:

1. Pirate computer - Access to the pirates salvaged computer set before the raid

2. Copying is not theft (requires Pirate computer DLC)

3. Why it sucked to be a pirate - By Sam O Nella Academy (negotations coming soon, for now, view it [here (YouTube link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORmUUhh6O-8)) (requires Pirate Computer DLC)

4. No other planned DLC at the moment. Requests for more content are welcome.
