### Description

A game that challenges the term “piracy” in regard to digital downloading:

An anti-copyright game that challenges the ethics of copyright

#### Story draft A

**The locations are entered by the user, it is a create your own story game**

You are a man named <username> and you have had a good life by downloading stuff you need, as you grew up in a >economic_situation_"choice"_here< in >location<

You are caught by the FBI, CIA, and NSA, who do a triple raid on your house, who come and destroy every electronic in your house, and tear it up to do so, and take you in. This is not your first time getting caught, and they threaten to take away your right to use a computer anywhere, and you are given a choice: the government is testing a new time machine program, and you can either go back to the year 1273 and live like a pirate and survive for 27 years to “fix” a problem, or you can be executed by firing squad (the latter option results in a game over screen, although the graphics can be altered to not show up based on violence preferences)

If you choose the time machine option after coming back, you can live out your life as a pirate.

Choose your pirate name: >PnameP<

##### Fall into piracy

You have to live like a pirate under horrible conditions. A pirate is not the thing you would see in the movies. All the food is rotten and stale, and you have to eat it in the dark just so you don’t have to see the maggots, and other infections on your food, and the beef jerky is the most horrible thing (this idea of food is inspired by a Sam O Nella video about pirates, which may be added as DLC with permission) although you can choose to be a vegetarian or vegan, but it makes it harder to get energy and is basically hardcore mode for survival.

Also, unlike the movies, you don’t get to swing around on ropes, and it can be incredibly gruesome (again, violence options can make this a lot less traumatic)

You go on a series of adventures over 27 years (up to the year 1300 AD) and can try to take over the other pirate ships.

<A bunch of pirate stuff here<, the story needs to be expanded here, as this is the main game portion

Time scale: unknown (not yet defined)

When you come back, all your stuff is still destroyed, and the government deems the test successful, but makes a decision to further take away your rights, but gives you the option to continue using the time machine

#### Side quests:

Infiltrate the East India company

#### Extra content (DLC without DRM or price)

Go back in time to get all your files back, and view them. One of the files you can browse on the computer is “copying is not theft.mp4”

Sam O Nella video on pirates (embedded via YouTube if permission is denied, as I don’t have the power to do that to him, nor do I want to, kind of ironic, but it is the current law)
